## Oh hello there.

- I’m currently working on [dtb](https://github.com/1x0DE5CA/dtb)
- I’m currently learning the depths of C++, and if I have time for it (or in the right mood rather), C#. I'm also dipping my toes into reversing and all that again.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. Well, if I'm being specific, I'd love to make something in low-level uh... areas of programming?, but not that someone would ever see my profile, so idk.

Anyway, here's what I've been listening to in past days:
- [Operation cute Massacre (feat. Yandere Chainsaw Regurgitation Factory) by Loli Noise Torture](https://youtu.be/36QxXubvRZ4?si=OIKrQCMWijICS37-)
- [Have You Ever Kissed a Girl Before? by Sorry about my name](https://youtu.be/jBq1SnKoqF4?si=NQclAtJlRt4xOWcl)
- [Faded before blossom by Item Caligo](https://youtu.be/AC-QuID476o?si=7SSxXsWBuW1mDN_P)
- [I'm tired of my life by waqs](https://youtu.be/TrPQjeeAHQU?si=sxHyDOyObuWHV30D)
